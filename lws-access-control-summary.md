# Linked Web Storage Access Control - Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the access control model proposed for the Linked Web Storage (LWS) specification, designed to provide a unified approach that can be adopted by major cloud storage providers while maintaining compatibility with existing Solid specifications.

## Key Deliverables

1. **Comprehensive Analysis Document** (`lws-access-control-policies.md`)
   - Analysis of access control features across major providers:
     - Google Drive (role-based permissions)
     - Microsoft OneDrive (Graph API permissions)
     - Dropbox (member-based permissions)
     - AWS S3 (IAM policies)
     - Solid WAC (mode-based permissions)
     - Solid ACP (policy-based access control)
   - Identification of common patterns and divergent approaches
   - Proposed unified LWS access control model
   - Implementation considerations and migration path

2. **RDF Vocabulary** (`vocabs/lws-acl.ttl`)
   - Complete OWL ontology for LWS access control
   - Core classes: Authorization, Policy, Principal, Resource, PermissionMode
   - Permission modes: Read, Write, Append, Delete, Control, Share
   - Support for temporal access, conditions, delegation, and groups
   - Provider capability negotiation vocabulary

3. **N3 Rules** (`rules/lws-acl.n3`)
   - Formal logic for access control evaluation
   - Rules for direct grants, group access, inheritance, and policies
   - Temporal validity and condition checking
   - Audit trail generation
   - Default deny semantics

## Core Design Principles

1. **Compatibility First**: Implementable as a facade over existing provider APIs
2. **Semantic Clarity**: RDF/Linked Data for interoperability
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic features universal, advanced optional
4. **Security by Default**: Fail closed, explicit grants required
5. **Auditability**: Clear authorization paths

## Key Features

### Universal Features (All Providers Must Support)
- Basic permission modes: Read, Write, Delete
- User and group principals
- Resource-level permissions
- Basic inheritance

### Advanced Features (Optional)
- Append and Control modes
- Conditional access (IP ranges, time periods)
- Policy-based authorization
- Delegated access (OAuth-style)
- Verifiable Credentials integration
- Fine-grained audit trails

## Provider Mapping Example

| LWS Mode | Google Drive | OneDrive | Dropbox | AWS S3 | WAC | ACP |
|----------|--------------|----------|---------|---------|-----|-----|
| Read | reader | read | viewer | s3:GetObject | acl:Read | acp:Read |
| Write | writer | write | editor | s3:PutObject | acl:Write | acp:Write |
| Control | owner | owner | owner | s3:PutBucketAcl | acl:Control | acp:Control |

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Basic Compatibility
- Core permission modes
- User/group principals
- Resource-level permissions

### Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Enhanced Features
- Append and Control modes
- Inheritance
- Time-based access

### Phase 3 (Months 7-12): Advanced Capabilities
- Conditional access
- Policy-based authorization
- Verifiable credentials

## Next Steps

1. **Provider Engagement**
   - Present proposal to Google, Microsoft, Dropbox, AWS teams
   - Gather feedback on implementation feasibility
   - Identify provider-specific constraints

2. **Reference Implementation**
   - Develop adapter interfaces
   - Create provider-specific adapters
   - Build conformance test suite

3. **Standards Process**
   - Incorporate into LWS specification
   - Coordinate with Solid community
   - Engage with W3C working group

## Benefits for Stakeholders

### For Storage Providers
- Standardized access control interface
- Reduced integration complexity for applications
- Enhanced interoperability

### For Application Developers
- Single API for multiple storage providers
- Rich semantic access control
- Support for advanced use cases

### For End Users
- Consistent permissions across providers
- Better control over data access
- Enhanced privacy and security

### For the Agentic Web
- Standardized way for AI agents to access user data
- Fine-grained permission delegation
- Audit trails for agent actions

## Conclusion

The proposed LWS access control model provides a pragmatic path forward that:
- Unifies access control across major storage providers
- Maintains compatibility with existing systems
- Enables rich semantic access control features
- Supports emerging use cases like agentic access
- Provides clear migration paths for adoption

This work positions LWS as the canonical standard for cloud storage access control, reducing fragmentation and enabling innovative applications while maintaining security and user control.
